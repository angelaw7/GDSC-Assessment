# Housing Application Q1

## Description
Using React, design a functional component that takes a list of positive and negative integers as
an input and returns one of five emojis for the size of its sum. The emoji should not be seen until
the submit button beside the input field is pressed and should fade out within a few seconds after
list submission (weâ€™ll leave the timing up to you). You may use any emoji as long as the number
ranges are the same as outlined in the table below. Beside the form component, create a legend
that informs the user of the number ranges for each emoji.
